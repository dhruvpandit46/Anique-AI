            <strong>Functionality of Pins:</strong><br>
            • Pin1 and Pin9 are “Enable” pins. They should be connected to +5V for the drivers to function. If they are pulled low (GND), then the outputs will be turned off regardless of the input states, stopping the motors. If you have two spare pins in your microcontroller, connect these pins to the microcontroller, or just connect them to regulated positive 5 Volts.<br>
            • Pin4, Pin5, Pin12, and Pin13 are ground pins that should ideally be connected to the microcontroller’s ground.<br>
            • Pin2, Pin7, Pin10 and Pin15 are logic input pins. These are control pins which should be connected to microcontroller pins. Pin2 and Pin7 control the first motor (left); Pin10 and Pin15 control the second motor (right).<br>
            • Pin3, Pin6, Pin11, and Pin14 are output pins. Tie Pin3 and Pin6 to the first motor, Pin11 and Pin14 to the second motor.<br>
            • Pin16 powers the IC and it should be connected to regulated +5Volts.<br>
            • Pin8 powers the two motors and should be connected to the positive lead of a secondary battery. As per the datasheet, supply voltage can be as high as 36 Volts.

            <strong>Description of Smart Irrigation System:</strong><br>
            • Smart irrigation systems estimate and measure diminution of existing plant moisture in order to operate an irrigation system, restoring water as needed while minimizing excess water use.<br>
            • Intelligent automatic plant irrigation system concentrates watering plants regularly without human monitoring using a moisture sensor.<br>
            • The sensors used require routine maintenance for proper performance. The system uses a hardware component, which is subjected to variation with the environmental conditions.<br>
            • A real-time wireless smart sensor array for scheduling irrigation prototyped a real-time, smart sensor array for measuring soil moisture and soil temperature that uses off-the-shelf components was developed and evaluated for scheduling irrigation.<br>
            • This system is specific for a crop and hence its usage is limited. Proper scheduling of irrigation is critical for efficient water management in crop production, particularly under conditions of water scarcity.<br>
            • The effects of the applied amount of irrigation water, irrigation frequency, and water use are particularly important.<br>
            • To improve water efficiency, there must be a proper irrigation scheduling strategy. So our project devises a simple system, using a microcontroller to automate the irrigation and watering of small potted plants or crops with minimal manual interventions.<br>
            • This technology is recommended for efficient automated irrigation systems, and it may provide a valuable tool for conserving water planning and irrigation scheduling which is extendable to other similar agricultural crops.<br>
            • Maximum absorption of the water by the plant is ensured by spreading the water uniformly using a servo motor. So there is minimal wastage of water.<br>
            • This system also allows controlling the amount of water delivered to the plants when it is needed based on types of plants by monitoring soil moisture and temperature.<br>
            • This project can be used in large agricultural areas where human effort needs to be minimized.<br>
            • Many aspects of the system can be customized and fine-tuned through software for a plant requirement.

        text: `
            <strong>Description of IoT-based Home Automation System:</strong><br>
            • An IoT-based Home Automation System typically involves various components interconnected to enable remote monitoring and control of home appliances and devices through the internet.<br>
            • <strong>Cloud Server (IoT Platform):</strong> This is where data from various IoT devices is sent and processed. It manages user accounts, stores data, and hosts applications for controlling devices remotely.<br>
            • <strong>Internet Gateway (Router):</strong> This allows communication between the home network and the internet, enabling remote access to the home automation system.<br>
            • <strong>User Device (Smartphone, PC, Tablet, etc.):</strong> This is the interface through which users interact with the home automation system. It connects to the cloud server to monitor and control devices.<br>
            • <strong>Home Network:</strong> This includes all the devices and appliances within the home connected to the IoT system, such as smart switches, bulbs, plugs, and other IoT devices.<br>
            • <strong>Sensors & Actuators:</strong> These devices sense environmental conditions or control physical elements in the home, such as lights, temperature, cameras, door locks, and motion sensors.<br>
            • <strong>Device Control System:</strong> Relays are used to provide connection between two or more points in response to the input signal. They are connected to fans and bulbs that act as output. Relays are used in many applications because of their relative simplicity, long life, and proven high reliability. Their function is to protect, regulate, and control the power. The relay module operates at around 5V level.<br>
            • <strong>IoT Devices & Appliances:</strong> These are the smart devices and appliances that are integrated into the home network and can be controlled remotely via the cloud server and user devices.<br>
            • <strong>Authentication Interface System:</strong> The central server can be accessed by the user authorized by a "user name" and a "password." The central server provides the user with the necessary data storage in the database. Upon gaining access to the central server, based on the information given, the user can then make queries or send commands. The IoT devices usually have an authentication method, which can be used for user administration or to connect the device to a central controller. When the user enters the correct information, they are directed to open the web page. On this web page, the appliances in the house can be controlled. They can be monitored, turned ON or OFF based on the desire of the house owner, depending on the situation of the house. The passwords can be tried until the correct password is entered. The username and password can be changed as with any other device.<br>
            • The system consists of different sensors like temperature, gas, PIR, and LDR. Initially, the system connects to the internet through Wi-Fi. Once the connection is established, it starts reading the parameters of the sensors. The threshold levels for the required sensors are set. The sensor data are sent to the web server and stored in the cloud and also displayed on the LCD screen. The condition of the house through the obtained data can be analyzed anywhere, anytime. In the proposed system, the temperature and cooking gas leakage in the house are being monitored, and the data thus obtained are stored in the cloud for analysis and also displayed on the LCD and in the web user interface. If the temperature exceeds the pre-defined threshold level, the cooler turns ON automatically and turns OFF when the temperature is back to the predefined value. Similarly, when there is a leakage of gas in the house, an alarm is turned ON, alerting the user about the leakage. The presence of humans is detected using the PIR motion sensor. The system turns ON the bulbs when the presence of a human is detected and turns OFF when the person is away. LDR is also integrated into the system. In case the user forgets to turn OFF the outdoor lights in the morning, they will switch OFF automatically. A dimmer circuit is provided to reduce the light intensity of the room according to the requirement of the user. The specialty here is that the light intensity can be controlled via the internet or mobile from a distance. The user can also monitor the electric appliances through the internet via the web server. If the lights or any electrical appliances are left turned ON in a hurry, they can be seen and turned OFF from anywhere by typing the IP address of the web server.

        text: `
            <strong>Description of Motorised Control Robotics System:</strong><br>
            • A basic block diagram of a Motorized Control Robotics System typically consists of several key components that work together to control the motion of a robot.<br>
            • <strong>Microcontroller/Processor:</strong> This is the brain of the system. It receives commands and data from various sources, processes them, and generates control signals for the motor and other peripheral devices.<br>
            • <strong>Sensors:</strong> These devices provide feedback about the environment and the robot's own state. Common sensors include encoders (to measure motor shaft position), proximity sensors, cameras, accelerometers, etc.<br>
            • <strong>Motor Driver:</strong> The motor driver amplifies the control signals generated by the microcontroller to provide the necessary power to drive the motors. It may include features such as PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) control to regulate motor speed and direction.<br>
            • <strong>Motors:</strong> These are the actuators responsible for the robot's movement. Depending on the application, different types of motors may be used, such as DC motors, stepper motors, servo motors, etc.<br>
            • <strong>Power Supply:</strong> This provides the necessary electrical power to the entire system. It must be capable of delivering sufficient current to drive the motors and other components.<br>
            • <strong>Control Algorithms:</strong> These are the software algorithms running on the microcontroller that govern the behavior of the robot. They may include motion planning algorithms, PID controllers for motor speed and position control, obstacle avoidance algorithms, etc.<br>
            • <strong>Communication Interface:</strong> This allows the robot to communicate with external devices or systems, such as a computer, smartphone, or other robots. Common interfaces include UART, SPI, I2C, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.<br>
            • <strong>User Interface:</strong> In some systems, there may be a user interface component, such as buttons, switches, touchscreens, or a graphical user interface (GUI) on a computer or mobile device, through which the user can interact with the robot, send commands, and receive feedback.<br>
            • These are the basic building blocks of a Motorized Control Robotics System. Depending on the specific application and complexity of the system, additional components and subsystems may be added to enhance functionality and performance.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Working of a Motorized Control Robotics System:</strong><br>
            • <strong>Input and Sensing:</strong> The robot receives input from various sensors, such as proximity sensors, cameras, or encoders. These sensors provide information about the robot's environment, including obstacles, terrain, and its own position and orientation.<br>
            • <strong>Data Processing:</strong> The input data from sensors is processed by the robot's controller, typically a microcontroller or single-board computer. The controller analyzes the sensor data to understand the robot's surroundings and determine the appropriate actions to take.<br>
            • <strong>Decision Making:</strong> Based on the processed sensor data and pre-defined algorithms or decision-making rules, the controller decides on the robot's next actions. This decision-making process may involve tasks such as obstacle avoidance, path planning, object detection, or manipulation.<br>
            • <strong>Motor Control:</strong> The controller generates commands to control the robot's motors based on its decisions. These commands include information such as motor speed, direction, and duration. The controller sends these commands to motor drivers, which interface between the controller and the motors.<br>
            • <strong>Motor Actuation:</strong> The motor drivers interpret the control commands and provide the necessary power and signals to the motors. Depending on the type of motors used (DC motors, stepper motors, servo motors, etc.), the motor drivers adjust the motors' speed, direction, and position accordingly.<br>
            • <strong>Movement and Task Execution:</strong> The motors receive signals from the motor drivers and actuate, causing the robot to move or perform specific tasks. For example, if the robot needs to navigate through an environment, the motors drive its wheels or legs to move forward, backward, turn, or stop as directed by the controller. If the robot needs to manipulate objects, the motors control its manipulator arms or grippers to grasp, lift, move, or release objects.<br>
            • <strong>Feedback and Iteration:</strong> During operation, the robot continues to receive feedback from sensors, allowing it to adapt its actions in real-time. The controller constantly updates its decisions based on the new sensor data, enabling the robot to navigate dynamic environments and perform complex tasks effectively.<br>
            • By following these steps, a motorized control robotics system enables a robot to autonomously move and interact with its environment, making it capable of performing a wide range of tasks in various applications, such as industrial automation, logistics, exploration, and surveillance.
